Should make a phantom div over the image, with a div for each pixel (use javascript obviously)
All the divs will have onclick -> js colour change function (for now), just to show that theyâ€™re highlighted
the next part is retrieving the coordinates

Need to run on a server (security issues)
Solution on mac with python: (run the following from terminal)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
