Solution on mac (provided python is installed):
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

The formula I have used:

Use AJAX to access files hosted by the server. This will allow me to make an
array of Subject objects, each having an array of Frame objects, each having
an array of markedCoordinates.
Side note: As I save to an excel sheet this array, I should also save the
coordinates used.
Update: I'm just going to have a standard of naming files after MPEG
    (s 001.png)
    So no need for Ajax


Need a reset button. After analyzing, if go to next subject, the coordinates
are the same and so is the coordinateArray and the data.

Right now program works at one subject at a time. Eventually I can consider
having a subjects array in which all subjects will exist.
  Why I might not need to do this: you still need to select markers for every
  subject. In terms of efficiency of retrieving data, not necessarily faster
  by having a subjects array. However, it will make analyzing data easier
  (because it would all be in one place, hypothetically in one excel file)
